# Git Basics

## View All Commits
To view all commits, use this command:
```
git log
```
<br>

The above command prints a lot of information. I found this command more useful than the above one as it only prints commit id and commit message for all commits.
```
git log --oneline
```

## List Git Tracking Files
This command lists down all the files which are being tracked by git.
```
git ls-files
```
