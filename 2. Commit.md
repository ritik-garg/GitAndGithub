# Check Status
This command returns the current state of the tracked files by git:
```
git status
```

# Add Files for Staging
This command add files for staging. Simple regex can also be used in place of *fileName*
```
git add <fileName>
```
<br>

To add all the files:
```
git add .
```

# Commiting a Change
```
git commit -m "<commitMessage>"
```
<br>

To add a multiline commit message, we can use the above command without the `-m` tag to open an editor:
```
git commit
```
<br>

To do an express commit(This commit directly adds all the tracked files and commits them. We don't have to run an explicit add command. I personally don't use this command much.)
```
git commit -am "<commitMessage>"
