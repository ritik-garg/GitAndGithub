# Check Status
This command returns the current state of the tracked/untracked files by git:
```
git status
```

## View All Commits
To view all commits, use this command:
```
git log
```
<br>

The above command prints a lot of information. I found this command more useful than the above one as it only prints commit id and commit message for all commits.
```
git log --oneline
```
<br>

Other parameters can also be added to git log command:
```
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```
<br>

View commits of a particular file:
```
git log --oneline -- <fileName>
```
<br>

To view a graph of all commits:
```
git log --oneline --graph
```

## List Git Tracking Files
This command lists down all the files which are being tracked by git.
```
git ls-files
```

## Rename a File
Git gives commands to rename a file. This gives advantage over normal rename as git will keep track of this rename.
```
git mv <oldFileName> <newFileName>
```

## Delete a File
Similar to rename, git also git delete functionality.
```
git rm <fileName>
```
