# Add Files for Staging
This command add files for staging. Simple regex can also be used in place of `fileName`
```
git add <fileName>
```
<br>

To add all the files:
```
git add .
```

# Commiting a Change
```
git commit -m "<commitMessage>"
```
<br>

To add a multiline commit message, we can use the above command without the `-m` tag to open an editor:
```
git commit
```
<br>

To do an express commit(This commit directly adds all the tracked files and commits them. We don't have to run an explicit add command. I personally don't use this command much.)
```
git commit -am "<commitMessage>"
```
<br>

To push an empty commit:
```
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Build"
```
This is very useful in cases when we just want to trigger an automatic job and we don't want to make unnecessary changes.

# Cherry-pick
This command helps you pick changes from one to and place it on another branch:
```
git cherry-pick <commitId>
```
<br>

Another common command is to use the range cherry-pick which places all commits from start to end (both inclusive) on top of each other:
```
git cherry-pick <startCommitId>^..<endCommitId>
```
To specify this range, we have used `^..` operator.
