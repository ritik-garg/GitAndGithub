# Unstage Changes
This command unstages a staged file. This does not reverts any changes. It could be useful when you don't want a file to be the part of current commit.
```
git restore --staged <fileName>
```
<br>

This command also unstage a file:
```
git reset HEAD <fileName>
```

# Revert File to Last Commit
To change the file back to its previous version, ie, to remove all uncommited changes, we can use either of these commands:
```
git restore <fileName>
```

```
git checkout -- <fileName>
```
