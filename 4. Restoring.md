# Unstage Changes
This command unstages a staged file. This does not reverts any changes. It could be useful when you don't want a file to be the part of current commit.
```
git restore --staged <fileName>
```
<br>

This command also unstage a file:
```
git reset HEAD <fileName>
```

# Revert File to Last Commit
To change the file back to its previous version, ie, to remove all uncommited changes, we can use either of these commands:
```
git restore <fileName>
```

```
git checkout -- <fileName>
```

# Reset and Reflog
Reset command can be used to change the position of HEAD to an older commit.
```
git reset --hard/soft/mixed <commitId>
```
<br>

Reflog command can be used to view actions taken in the past and reset command can be used to go back to a previous version, ie, the time before executing those commands:
```
git reflog
```

# Stash
If we want to switch between tasks or want to temporarily revert our changes to the latest commit, we can use stash command:
```
git stash
```
<br>

This command lists down all the stashed changes that we have:
```
git stash list
```
<br>

To apply the stash:
```
git stash pop
```
