# Taking Difference
Diff command can be used to see the difference between 2 commits:
```
git diff <commitId1> <commitId2>
```
Or
```
git diff <branchName1> <branchName2>
```
<br>

If you want to see the changes in the untracked files, just use:
```
git diff
```
<br>

Difftool can be used to view the difference in an IDE:
```
git diff <commitId1> <commitId2>
```
