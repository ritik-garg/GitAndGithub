# Remote Repository
This command lets you check if you have a remote repository setup or not:
```
git remote -v
```
<br>

To add a remote repository to local project:
```
git remote add <alias> <repositoryLink>
```

For eg, 
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/ritik-garg/GitAndGithub.git
```
<br>

If we have updated the name of our remote repository, we need to change the remote reference as well:
```
git remote set-url <alias> <sshUrl>
```

# Cloning
If we already have a github repository, we can clone it in local:
```
git clone <sshUrl> <localRepositoryName>
```

`localRepositoryName` is optional. It keeps the same name as remote repository if not specified.

# Pushing Changes to Remote Repository
```
git push -u origin <branchName> --tags
```
`origin` is the alias we gave above and `--tags` will push tags as well.

# Fetch vs Pull
The fetch command only brings in data from the remote repository. It does not update the current branch with the changes.
```
git fetch
```
<br>

The fetch command can also be used to updated deleted references to remote branches:
```
git fetch -p
```
<br>

The pull command is a combination of fetch and merge command, where is merges the fetched changes onto the current branch.
```
git pull
```
<br>

To pull changes of all branches:
```
git pull --all
```
<br>

Pull changes with rebae (This is the command I most often use for pulling changes):
```
git pull --rebase
```
