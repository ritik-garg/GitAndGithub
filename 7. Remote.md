# Remote Repository
This command lets you check if you have a remote repository setup or not:
```
git remote -v
```
<br>

To add a remote repository to local project:
```
git remote add <alias> <repositoryLink>
```

For eg, 
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/ritik-garg/GitAndGithub.git
```

# Pushing Changes to Remote Repository
```
git push -u origin master --tags
```
`origin` is the alias we gave above, `master` is the name of the branch that we want to push and `--tags` will push tags as well.
